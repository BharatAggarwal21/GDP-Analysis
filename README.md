# GDP-Analysis
This project helps in determining the GDP of the countries taking in consideration the different factors contributing towards the calculation of it. Countries which are in developing stage can mark the important features that will help in increasing their economic growth. The economists analyse the previous trends and respond to the changes needed proactively for the effective growth of the country which we also will be trying to analyse.
<h3>Design of datasets:</h3>
1. GDP values - It is containing the GDP values for different countries from year 1970-2018(in rows we have the countries and in colums we have the years)

2.	Agriculture-It is containing the investment in the Agricultural field for different countries from year 1970-2018(in rows we have the countries and in colums we have the years)

3.	Education-It is containing the investment in the Educational field for different countries from year 1970-2018(in rows we have the countries and in colums we have the years)

4.	Exports-It is containing the revenue in the Exports for different countries from year 1970-2018(in rows we have the countries and in colums we have the years)

5.	Research and Development-It is containing the investment in the R&D field for different countries from year 1970-2018(in rows we have the countries and in colums we have the years)

<h3>Results</h3>
The Feature importance section graphs are showing the importance of each field or factor for different countries on a scale of 0-1.
For example for INDIA, we got the highest value in the EXPORTS field so we observe that EXPORTS from INDIA determine the GDP of INDIA on a greater extent.
This method can be used to find out the important factor that the country must focus upon to raise its GDP. Other countries may have other factors as the important one.

<br>
The next section comprises of Linear Regression Random Forest and other models showing the accuracy of prediction of GDP values with the help of these factors.
<br>
The last step is to calculate the values for these factors so that we can have a estimate of the GDP of the future years.
